# pands-problem-set

First Python problem set 2019 - total of 10 problems.

A readme should give a brief introduction to your software.

Maybe write a small paragraph about each problem and the steps towards solving it. Should I mention mistakes made and how they were solved? I suppose instead I should explain the thought process behind each solution... why did I do it this way instead of another? But a lot of of the code solutions just "came to me" I suppose, as I tried to apply my very limited knowledge of python to each problem.
